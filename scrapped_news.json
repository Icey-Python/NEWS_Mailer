It\u2019s removing the barriers standing in our way.\u201cAfrican countries possess the tools, talent and renewable resources to fuel their own growth and be at the vanguard of efforts to tackle climate change, poverty and inequality everywhere. But they are being blocked by a broken global financial system that denies them access to the affordable finance needed to unleash this potential.\u201cNo country must choose between improving the lives of their people and protecting the planet.

He has previously desecrated the Quran, in a series of anti-Islam protests, and his actions have caused\u00a0diplomatic outrage across the Middle East.A group of angry protesters tried to stop the burning, which resulted in a showdown between them and police.Officers said they were pelted with stones, while some demonstrators threw electric scooters at police vehicles.Several police cars were set on fire in Malmo's Rosengard neighbourhood, which has a a large immigrant population, and has experienced other violent protests in the past.\"I understand that a public gathering like this arouses strong emotions, but we cannot tolerate disturbances and violence like the ones we saw on Sunday afternoon,\" Malmo police area commander Petra Stenkula told local media.\"It is extremely regrettable to once again see violence and vandalism at Rosengard.\"Scandinavia has witnessed a spate of Quran burnings this year.In June, Mr Momika set fire to a copy outside Stockholm's central mosque, as Muslims celebrated the first day of Eid al-Adha - one of the most important festivals in the Muslim calendar.Swedish police had given Mr Momika a permit for the protest, in accordance with their staunch free-speech laws. It later emerged the incident was being investigated for incitement of hatred.In January, Rasmus Paludan, a politician from the Danish far-right Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party, burnt a copy of the Quran outside the Turkish embassy in Stockholm.Last month, neighbouring Denmark, which has also seen a several public burnings of the Quran, said it planned to ban public desecration of holy books.Sweden has pledged to explore legal means of abolishing protests that involve burning texts in certain circumstances.

Among other things, the two countries are\u00a0facing off against each other along their disputed border\u00a0in the Himalayan region. 0Just last week, India protested after Beijing released a\u00a0map that claims the state of Arunachal Pradesh and the Aksai Chin plateau as Chinese territory.Mr Xi and Mr Biden may still have an opportunity to speak in November, at a meeting among leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation in San Francisco.About two months after the two leaders met in the Indonesian island of Bali last November, an alleged Chinese spy balloon in skies above the US punctured hopes for a re-set in bilateral relations, delaying efforts to kickstart dialogue by months.The two countries disagree over a range of issues - Russia's invasion of Ukraine, human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, territorial claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea, and economic restrictions that limit Beijing's access to high-tech components.In an attempt to improve ties, a series of top US officials have travelled to China in recent months. They include Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and US Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry.Meanwhile, Mr Xi continues to portray Beijing as a leader of the developing world, rallying support for\u00a0an alternative to the Washington-led world order.In a visit to South Africa last month to meet with leaders of the Brics nations, he criticised the West's \"hegemony\" and urged developing nations to \"[shake] off the yoke of colonialism\" in his speeches.The Brics originally refers to five-nation club of developing countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Six new countries - Argentina, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - are set to join in January, in what's widely seen as a diplomatic win for Beijing.

As well as attacking each other, they smashed shop windows and cars.The divisions within Eritrea over the rule of President Isaias Afwerki have spilled over into the diaspora, and this is the latest outbreak of violence in recent weeks.Residents said the streets of central Tel Aviv sounded like a war zone over several hours, with police helicopters hovering overhead and sirens blaring.Hardline choicesThe rioting has put the divisive issue of migrants back on the political agenda, at a time when\u00a0Israel is already split over the hardline government's highly controversial judicial overhaul plan.Mr Netanyahu and others in his cabinet have blamed the Supreme Court for blocking earlier attempted action to push migrants out of Israel.\"Now there remains a serious problem with the illegal infiltrators in south Tel Aviv and elsewhere,\" the prime minister said at Sunday's special government meeting.\"We want harsh measures against the rioters, including the immediate deportation of those who took part.\"He requested that the ministers present him with plans \"for the removal of all the other illegal infiltrators\".The far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir now plans to propose a bill that would overturn part of Israel's quasi-constitutional basic law on human dignity and liberty to press ahead with the mass deportation of migrants who entered the country illegally.It is estimated that there are about 18,000 asylum seekers from Eritrea in Israel, most of whom arrived illegally years ago by crossing Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. They say they fled danger, persecution and compulsory military conscription in one of the world's most repressive countries.Although Eritreans supporting the regime would not appear to be in need of international protection as refugees, the authorities in Israel have not made differentiations between asylum seekers based on their political affiliations until now.As Eritrea marks 30 years of independence from Ethiopia, festivals have been held by its diaspora.But as well as Israel, some in Europe and North America have been marred by outbreaks of violence - last month a three-day Eritrean cultural festival in Toronto, Canada, was cancelled after supporters and opponents of Eritrea's regime clashed.

She had taken her own life.Min-so's cousin, Park Du-yong, struggles not to cry as he straightens out her small, empty apartment, now home to just her goldfish. Her bed is unmade, and beside it sits a pile of drawings from her first-grade students, telling her how much they loved her. Underneath is a stack of library books on how to cope with depression.Park says his cousin had been teaching for little over a year, fulfilling her childhood dream by following her mother into the profession. She had adored the kids, he says.So in the days after his cousin's death, which police quickly pinned on a recent breakup, Park assumed the role of detective. He unearthed hundreds of diary entries, work logs and text messages.They revealed that in the months leading up to her suicide, Min-so had been bombarded by complaints from parents. Most recently, one of her pupils had slashed another child's head with a pencil, and she'd been embroiled in heated late phone calls and messages with the parents.This tragedy has unleashed a wave of anger from primary school teachers across South Korea, who have started to share their experiences of being bullied by overbearing parents and unruly children. Tens of thousands of them have gone on strike to demand better protection at work.They say parents frequently push them to breaking point, by calling their personal phones every hour of the day and weekends, incessantly and unfairly complaining.Some of the complaints have an especially sinister edge. Teachers can be reported for child abuse for restraining a violent child, while a telling off is frequently labelled as emotional abuse. Such accusations can see teachers immediately removed from their jobs.One teacher received a complaint after denying a parent's request to wake their child up with a phone call each morning. Another was reported for emotional abuse after taking reward stickers off a boy who had cut his classmate with scissors.For the past six weeks, tens of thousands of teachers have rallied in Seoul, claiming they are now so scared of being called child abusers, they are unable to discipline their students and intervene as they attack each other.They accuse parents of exploiting a child welfare law, passed in 2014, which dictates that teachers who are accused of child abuse are automatically suspended.At one protest, 28-year old teacher Kim Jin-seo said that she had experienced suicidal thoughts, and needed three months off work, following two particularly aggressive complaints. In one case she had asked a disruptive pupil to take five minutes to gather their thoughts in the toilet, while in the other she had reported a child to his parents for fighting. In both instances, the school forced her to apologise.Kim said she reached the point where she did not feel she could safely teach her class: \"We teachers feel extremely disempowered. Those who have had experienced this first-hand are fundamentally changed, and those who haven't, have seen it happen to others, so either way it is debilitating.\"Fuelling this culture of complaining is South Korea's hyper-competitive society, where almost everything hinges on academic success. Students compete fiercely for the best grades from a very young age, to one day get into the best universities. Outside school, parents send their children to study at expensive extra-curriculum schools known as hagwons, which operate from 5am to 10pm. Whereas families in Korea used to have five or six children, now most have just one, meaning they have just one shot at success.

The former civil servant rose to fame during her investigation of Partygate.It is not expected that Sir Keir will swap his most senior colleagues - including the shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting and shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper.Angela Rayner was directly elected to be deputy leader by party members, meaning she will keep that position no matter what.But she also currently shadows the Cabinet Office brief, which focusses on government procedure and the effective running of government. In government the Cabinet Office is headed up by Ms Rayner's opposite number the deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden.In recent years she has focused heavily on scrutinising ethical issues in politics, from so-called \"sleaze\" to accusing her opposite numbers of \"wasting taxpayers money\".Some Labour sources expect that she may be put in charge of running a specific, domestic policy area instead.A few names that have been tipped for possible promotion include the chair of parliament's business committee - Darren Jones.He has been widely regarded as an effective communicator and his forensic grilling of companies such as Thames Water, Royal Mail and P&O at various committee hearings has often landed him positive headlines.If promoted, it is not clear what policy area could be vacated for him to fill. He could possibly cover the environment, if Jim McMahon is demoted.Labour still also has not appointed anyone to shadow the government's new\u00a0science, innovation and technology secretary.Mr Jones has been vocal about, for example, his belief that Artificial Intelligence and technology can be a \"force for good\" if adopted in the right way and should be central to Labour's plans for improving education or the NHS.Lucy Powell currently covers the digital, culture and media brief for Labour so could also be a potential candidate should this role be filled.Rishi Sunak also\u00a0made a few changes\u00a0to his top team last Thursday.He replaced the former defence secretary Ben Wallace with Grant Shapps, and promoted his close ally Claire Coutinho to be the energy and net zero secretary.The prime minister is expected to carry out a wider government reshuffle in the coming months.Both parties are holding annual party conferences in October and both leaders are hoping to get their top teams in shape ahead of the next general election - expected at some point next year.

", "content": "   Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has been dismissed from his post, the country's leader Volodymyr Zelensky has announced.Mr Reznikov had led the ministry since before the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.But in his nightly address, President Zelensky said it was time for \"new approaches\" in the defence ministry.Rustem Umerov, who runs Ukraine's State Property Fund, has been nominated by Mr Zelensky as Mr Reznikov's successor.\"I believe that the ministry needs new approaches and other formats of interaction with both the military and society as a whole,\" the Ukrainian president said in his address from the capital Kyiv.Ukrainian media has speculated that Mr Reznikov will become Kyiv's new ambassador in London, where he has developed good relations with senior politicians.The 57-year-old has become a well-known figure since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. Internationally recognised, he has regularly attended meetings with Ukraine's western allies and played a key role in lobbying for additional military equipment.But his dismissal has been anticipated for some time. Last week, Mr Reznikov told reporters he was exploring other positions with the Ukrainian president.According to local media, the former defence minister said that if Mr Zelensky offered the opportunity for him to work on another project he would probably agree.Ukrainian defence advisor Yuriy Sak told the BBC that Mr Reznikov spearheaded the transformation of the ministry, laying the groundwork for future NATO membership.\"His legacy is that he has convinced ministers of defence around the world that the impossible is possible,\" he said in reference to Mr Reznikov's successful lobbying of foreign governments for arms.But experts have observed that the cabinet reshuffle is unlikely to lead to any major change in Ukraine's battlefield strategy, with Gen Valery Zaluzhny - the commander of Ukraine's armed forces - overseeing the campaign.Mr Reznikov's dismissal comes amid a wider anti-corruption drive in Mr Zelensky's administration, with weeding out graft in the state seen as essential to Ukraine's desire to join Western institutions like the EU.According to the\u00a0Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index,\u00a0Ukraine ranks 116th out of 180, but efforts in recent years have seen its position improve significantly.While Mr Reznikov is not personally accused of corruption, there have been a number of scandals at the ministry of defence involving the procurement of goods and equipment for the army at inflated prices.Earlier this year Mr Reznikov's deputy, Vyacheslav Shapovalov, resigned in the wake of the scandal. It was widely reported at the time that Mr Reznikov barely held on to his own post.At the time, he said the stress he had endured was \"hard to measure precisely\", adding that his \"conscience is absolutely clear\".The defence ministry has also been rocked by several recent arrests at regional recruitment offices, where officers have been accused of taking bribes to allow men to avoid Ukraine's military draft.On Friday, the US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with senior Ukrainian anti-corruption officials and urged them to continue prosecuting anti-graft cases \"no matter where they lead\".Mr Reznikov will be replaced by Mr Umerov, who represented Ukraine in peace talks at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion.The ex-MP allegedly suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning during peace negotiations in March 2022 alongside Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich - who was also part of the negotiating party. In a statement posted to Facebook he later denied the reports, urging people not to trust \"unverified information\".Speaking to the BBC at the time, he said it took courage to find solutions but he was determined \"to find [a] political and diplomatic resolution to this brutal invasion\".A member of the Crimean Tatar community, he has become a key member of Mr Zelensky's international outreach efforts, focussing on fostering ties in the Islamic world.Mr Reznikov's dismissal comes as Ukraine wages a slow and bloody counter-offensive after securing more advanced weapons from Western allies.Progress on the frontline has been slow but top Ukrainian generals said on Sunday that their forces have broken through a key line of Russian defences in the south of the country.Meanwhile, Russia reported several attempted drone attacks on its territory overnight.The defence ministry said it shot down two drones over the Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, early on Monday.The region's governor Roman Stravoit also reported on Sunday that debris from a destroyed drone had caused a fire at a non-residential building in the city of Kurchatov.Elsewhere, Russia launched its own overnight attack on Izmail port - one of Ukraine's two major grain-exporting ports on the Danube River in the Odesa region.The Danube ports have become Ukraine's major exporting route since the collapse of the Black Sea grain deal in July.Moscow has launched frequent attacks on the Danube since withdrawing from the deal.

The person's family had been notified, the statement added.The unusual rainstorms came towards the end of the nine-day festival, when the biggest crowds arrive to see the grand finale - the burning of the giant wooden man.The worst of the rain has now passed, according to BBC Weather, but there is still a risk of some further showers and thunderstorms.It could be several days before the ground dries up enough for people to leave and for this reason, they have been told to conserve their food, water and fuel.The festival's toilets are also out of use, revellers say, because the service vehicles cannot drive on the mud to empty them.According to the sheriff's office, some people who had tried to drive out of the festival had instead made the muddy ground even worse.Festival-goers told the BBC they watched on as some people tried to drive away - but they quickly became bogged in the thick clay-like mud.More than 70,000 people had arrived at the site before it was closed on Saturday but the exact number of those still there is unclear.Some have managed to leave the site, however, American DJ Diplo\u00a0wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that he and comedian Chris Rock walked 5 miles (8km) to a road, where they were given a lift by fans.Others have also had to rely on strangers.Ashley Smith, who lives in London, told the BBC that he and his friends left a lot of their gear behind and walked to the road, where they managed to hitchhike to San Francisco. The whole journey took 14 hours.The event's organisers have arranged for buses to pick people up from the road and take them to the city of Reno, more than 100 miles away.Photos show tents partially submerged in muddy flood water.Milia Nirshberg, 12, who is at the festival with her father for the second year running, told the BBC that they had let friends stay in their campervan, and were also allowing people to use the van's toilet.\"The people in the tents are having a hard time because it's flooding. Since we're in a campervan we're trying to invite people to come stay with us because they don't have food or water,\" she said.Burning Man is one of America's most well-known arts and culture events. Visitors create a temporary city in the middle of the desert, and are expected to be largely self-sufficient while they are there.\"We have come here knowing this is a place where we bring everything we need to survive,\" said Burning Man in a statement. \"It is because of this that we are all well-prepared for a weather event like this.\"As well as music, the festival usually features giant interactive art installations - but many of the attractions had to be cancelled.Nonetheless, many were trying to make the best of the situation, dancing in the mud to techno music.\"We're taking it as an opportunity to hang out and spend more time with our new friends and old friends in the camp,\" reveller, Josiah Roe said.Burning Man was founded in June 1986 and was first held in Nevada's Black Rock Desert in 1990.Tickets can be very hard to get and festival-goers sometimes interview to get into popular camps and have to prove their commitment to its ideals.Some groups spend the entire year planning their camp, artwork and theme.But this year there had been worries about the weather and tickets were changing hands on the secondary market at below market rate.

", "content": "   Ukrainian generals claim they have breached Russia's formidable first line of defences in the south, as the counter-offensive launched earlier this summer may be poised to gather pace.Since June, Kyiv's territorial gains have been very small - but is Ukraine finally at a turning point?\"Yes, it's true,\" says Yuriy Sak, an advisor to Ukraine's defence minister, when asked if the breach had happened.\"Little by little, I think we're gaining momentum,\" he said.\"We are now between the first and second defensive lines,\" one of Ukraine's top generals in the south, Brig Gen Oleksandr Tarnavskiy told Britain's Observer newspaper.His words echoed those of the White House spokesman John Kirby, who on Friday told reporters in Washington that Ukrainian forces had \"achieved some success against that second line.\"The focus of Ukraine's counter-offensive effort in recent weeks has been an expanding bridgehead around the tiny village of Robotyne, some 56km (35 miles) south-east of the city of Zaporizhzhia.Ukrainian forces raised the country's blue and yellow flag over the village more than a week ago, and are now trying to widen the gap to allow larger infantry and armoured units to pass through without coming under Russian fire.If that can be achieved, there is a chance Ukraine's offensive can gain momentum as it approaches second and third defensive lines, which may not be quite as robust as the first.Fighting has been reported east of Robotyne, on the edge of the larger village of Verbove, but like everything so far, it's slow, painstaking work.A glance at the map shows a mass of overlapping, complex Russian defensive lines, complete with minefields, tank traps and trenches. Some of them converge at Verbove.Without air cover and in the face of sometimes withering Russian artillery fire, small Ukrainian units have been clearing a way through these hazards, preparing the ground for a larger assault.\"When these openings appear, of course, it makes it easier for our forces to advance,\" Mr Sak said.The fog of warIt is hard to assess the significance of the latest claims. Ukrainian officials are extremely tight-lipped when asked for precise details, preferring to allow the fog of war to shroud Kyiv's intentions and extremely reluctant to avoid releasing sensitive information.It does not help that the forces closest to the fight sometimes give very different accounts of what is happening at the front.Approached by the BBC on Saturday, Ukraine's 46th Air Assault Brigade said fighting was continuing near Russia's first line of defence, but that \"no one has yet managed to go beyond the first line.\"This may be less surprising than it sounds. A plethora of units are operating up and down the front, each concentrating on their own narrow section and specific tasks. They do not necessarily know what is going on elsewhere.One of those units, a volunteer battalion known by its commander's call sign \"Skala\", told Reuters news agency that its men had broken through Russia's first line on 26 August.On Sunday, Skala told us his men were still pushing forward.\"Literally, we are moving along the Zaporizhzhia region to the sea,\" he said in a voice message, without giving further details.\"I don't want to rush ahead, but both we and the General Staff are doing everything for the fastest victory.\"Hard as it is to gauge the precise nature and direction of Ukraine's recent gains, it is clear that the Kremlin is alarmed.It has recently sent elite troops from other parts of the long front line to bolster defences between Robotyne and the key road and railway hub of Tokmak, 21km to the south.According to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), this is the third time since June.\"The second lateral deployment in the span of a few weeks suggests an increasing Russian concern about the stability of Russian defences,\" the ISW reported in its assessment on 1 September.This, Ukrainian experts claim, is part of Kyiv's plan: forcing Moscow to move front line units from one place to another in an effort to wear them down.\"We're trying to involve their reserves and exhaust them,\" says Serhiy Kuzan, of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre, a Kyiv think tank with close ties to the military.The next job, he says, is to exploit any sign of Russian weakness.\"The main thing is to widen this bridgehead,\" he says. \"There won't be any orders to go deeper until we do that.\"Despite the apparently glacial progress of the offensive since June, Mr Kuzan says the fundamental objective has not changed: control of the south.What that looks like by the time winter arrives is an open question.Ideally, Kyiv would like its forces to have reached the Sea of Azov, cutting through Moscow's \"land bridge\" to the Crimean Peninsula.But even if this does not happen, Ukraine is determined to cut the supply lines that allow Russian forces to maintain a presence in the southern part of the Kherson region, between the Dnipro river and Crimea.Some of those links, including the railway that passes through Tokmak, are already highly vulnerable to Ukrainian long range weapons, such as the\u00a0Himars multiple rocket launcher.With the other key rail link - the one across the Kerch Bridge - the target of repeated Ukrainian attacks since last October, Mr Kuzan says Russia is transporting 70% of its supplies along the M-14 highway, which runs closer to the coast.\"We have to get the land route\u2026 under fire control,\" he says, meaning that Ukrainian guns need to be close enough to be able to target the road.That's still a distant goal.The M-14 is still more than 80km away. There are multiple Russian lines of defence, and Ukrainian forces will be attacked from the ground and air every step of the way.Another glance at the map shows that Ukraine's territorial gains, since June, have been tiny.Kyiv's first encounter with Russia's well-entrenched defences was always going to be among the hardest phases. It may be some time before we know if the breach at Robotyne represents a turning point.\"Tough battles are to be expected,\" Mr Kuzan adds.

It is planning to introduce 5G wireless broadband services in 200 million homes and develop 2,000 megawatts of AI-ready computing capacity.It plans an ambitious wind energy business and a solar giga factory. The firm's ambitious retail arm has revived a popular 1970s soft drink,\u00a0Campa Cola, and is planning to take it global.Sandeep Nerlekar, who runs succession advisory firm Terentia Consultants, says that Mr Ambani and his wife Nita have been grooming their children for this moment for years.\"They did not inherit the business just because they're Mukesh Ambani's children, it's a well-thought- out strategy. He has taken time to plan a succession, very clearly identifying business vertical based on their strengths.\"Mr Ambani has been\u00a0described as an \"inscrutable\" man\u00a0who was raised poor and prefers to maintain a low profile. His children grew up in utmost luxury. They were raised in mansions, frequently traveling on private planes and mingling with celebrities.Unlike Mr Ambani, who had to drop out of Stanford to look after his father's business, twins Isha and Akash graduated from Yale and Brown, respectively. Together, they routinely make appearances in corporate events and adorn the covers of magazines. Both of them have married into other wealthy industrialist families, with the lavish ceremonies graced by stars from across the world, including Beyonc\u00e9.Mr Nerlekar says the entire family, including Mr Ambani, has been \"under the radar\" for various reasons including their spends on luxury, weddings and properties. The fact that the children are still young heightens the excitement around their lives and could now put them under more spotlight - but \"they know what they are doing and have been groomed well\".After completing college, Akash joined the leadership team at the group's telecom unit, Reliance Jio, in 2014. He manages the Mumbai Indians cricket team in the cash-rich Indian Premier League. Akash was also part of a team that brokered a $5.7bn investment in 2020 by Meta Platforms in a Reliance unit, Jio Platforms.Isha, on the other hand, has been already tasked with driving the company's retail, e-commerce and luxury plans. She is said to be behind the firm's expanding presence in fashion through the company's e-commerce app as well as its growing partnerships with top international luxury brands.Isha's rise in Reliance's core business is significant because she has been given a senior leadership role, when other women in the family have played largely peripheral roles in the business till now. In 2021, Fortune magazine referred to her as\u00a0\"heiress on duty\"\u00a0while ranking her the 21st most powerful woman in India. And according to her father, she is also feisty.In an interview with the New York Times, Mr Ambani said that his daughter often questioned her father's way of doing business. She once asked him to \"re-evaluate\" his portfolio, he recalled, because some of his companies were in the plastics business, which \"pollutes a lot\".The younger son, Anant, is involved in Reliance's energy businesses, which range from fossil fuels to developing solar panel manufacturing. Also a graduate of Brown University, Anant, who serves on the board of Reliance Charity alongside his mother, is often seen accompanying her to their team's cricket matches during the IPL season.Himanshu Rai, director of IIM-Indore, told Business Standard newspaper that the succession was a positive signal to all stakeholders and \"will also prevent any dispute in the future\".Many remember the bitter feud between Mr Ambani and his younger brother, Anil Ambani, over their inherited conglomerate after their father's death in 2002. Without a will to divide the assets, the brothers could not agree on how to run the family business for years before their mother worked out a compromise.\"What they went through was bitter so they would want to define their succession at the right time,\" Mr Nerlekar says.He adds that after the pandemic, people around the world are focusing more on their own mortality, wanting to put their succession plans and wills in order. \"The uncertainty and the simple fact that you could fall seriously ill or die has played a part in Mukesh Ambani's succession plan.\"The change in leadership also comes at a time when the Ambani empire's dominance has been challenged by the rise of coal and infrastructure tycoon Gautam Adani, who briefly overtook him as Asia's richest man last year.

The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony is held on the same day in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.In its announcement on Saturday, the Nobel Foundation defended its earlier decision, saying \"it is important and right to reach out as widely as possible with the values and messages that the Nobel Prize stands for - for example, through last year's clear political message with the peace prize awarded to human rights fighters from Russia and Belarus as well as to Ukrainians who work with documenting Russian war crimes\".But it acknowledged that the reaction had \"overshadowed this message\".\"We, therefore, choose to repeat last year's exception to regular practice - that is, to not invite the ambassadors of Russia, Belarus and Iran to the Nobel Prize award ceremony in Stockholm.

In government the Cabinet Office is headed up by Ms Rayner's opposite number the deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden.In recent years she has focused heavily on scrutinising ethical issues in politics, from so-called \"sleaze\" to accusing her opposite numbers of \"wasting taxpayers money\".Some Labour sources expect that she may be put in charge of running a specific, domestic policy area instead.A few names that have been tipped for possible promotion include the chair of parliament's business committee - Darren Jones.He has been widely regarded as an effective communicator and his forensic grilling of companies such as Thames Water, Royal Mail and P&O at various committee hearings has often landed him positive headlines.If promoted, it is not clear what policy area could be vacated for him to fill. He could possibly cover the environment, if Jim McMahon is demoted.Labour still also has not appointed anyone to shadow the government's new\u00a0science, innovation and technology secretary.Mr Jones has been vocal about, for example, his belief that Artificial Intelligence and technology can be a \"force for good\" if adopted in the right way and should be central to Labour's plans for improving education or the NHS.Lucy Powell currently covers the digital, culture and media brief for Labour so could also be a potential candidate should this role be filled.Rishi Sunak also\u00a0made a few changes\u00a0to his top team last Thursday.He replaced the former defence secretary Ben Wallace with Grant Shapps, and promoted his close ally Claire Coutinho to be the energy and net zero secretary.The prime minister is expected to carry out a wider government reshuffle in the coming months.Both parties are holding annual party conferences in October and both leaders are hoping to get their top teams in shape ahead of the next general election - expected at some point next year.

They include Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and US Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry.Meanwhile, Mr Xi continues to portray Beijing as a leader of the developing world, rallying support for\u00a0an alternative to the Washington-led world order.In a visit to South Africa last month to meet with leaders of the Brics nations, he criticised the West's \"hegemony\" and urged developing nations to \"[shake] off the yoke of colonialism\" in his speeches.The Brics originally refers to five-nation club of developing countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Six new countries - Argentina, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - are set to join in January, in what's widely seen as a diplomatic win for Beijing.

But that has all changed.In the years leading up to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, diplomats lost their authority, their role reduced to echoing the Kremlin's aggressive rhetoric.BBC Russian asks former diplomats, as well as ex-Kremlin and White House insiders, how Russian diplomacy broke down.In October 2021, US Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland went to a meeting at the Russian foreign ministry in Moscow. The man across the table was Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who Ms Nuland had known for decades and always got along with.Mr Rybakov's American counterparts saw him as a practical, calm negotiator - someone they could talk to even as the two countries' relationship frayed.This time, things were different.Mr Ryabkov read Moscow's official position from a piece of paper and resisted Ms Nuland's attempts to start a discussion. Ms Nuland was shocked, according to two people who discussed the incident with her.She described Mr Ryabkov and one of his colleagues as \"robots with papers\", the people said (the State Department declined to comment on the incident).And outside the negotiating room, Russian diplomats were using increasingly undiplomatic language.\"We spit on Western sanctions.\"\"Let me speak. Otherwise, you will really hear what Russian Grad missiles are capable of.\"\"Morons\" - preceded by an expletive.These are all quotes from people in positions of authority at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in recent years.How did we get here?A new Cold WarIt might be hard to imagine now, but Mr Putin himself told the BBC back in 2000 that \"Russia is ready to co-operate with Nato... right up to joining the alliance\".\"I cannot imagine my country isolated from Europe,\" he added.Back then, early in his presidency, Mr Putin was eager to build ties with the West, a former senior Kremlin official told the BBC., leading talks on deeper co-operation with European countries, and ensuring a peaceful transition after a revolution in Georgia.But as Mr Putin became more powerful and experienced, he became increasingly convinced he had all the answers and that diplomats were unnecessary, says Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, who is living in exile in Berlin.The first signal that a new Cold War was beginning came in 2007 with a speech Mr Putin made to the Munich Security Conference.In a 30-minute diatribe, he accused Western countries of attempting to build a unipolar world. Russia's diplomats followed his lead. A year later, when Russia invaded Georgia, Moscow's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly swore at his UK counterpart, David Miliband, asking: \"Who are you to lecture me?\"Western officials still thought it was worth trying to work with Russia. In 2009, Mr Lavrov and the then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pressed a giant red \"reset button\" in relations, and the two countries seemed to be building co-operation - especially on security issues.But it soon became obvious to US officials that their Russian counterparts were simply parroting Mr Putin's growing anti-Western views, says Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor to former US President Barack Obama.Mr Rhodes recalls President Obama having breakfast with Mr Putin in 2009, accompanied by a folk orchestra. He says Mr Putin was more interested in presenting his view of the world than discussing co-operation and that the Russian leader blamed Mr Obama's predecessor, George W Bush, for betraying Russia.As the Arab Spring, the US involvement in Libya, and the Russian street protests unfolded in 2011 and 2012, Mr Putin decided that diplomacy wouldn't get him anywhere, Mr Rhodes says.\"On certain issues - Ukraine in particular - I did not get the sense that [diplomats] had much influence at all,\" says Mr Rhodes.As an example, when Mr Lavrov, the foreign minister, was appointed nearly 20 years ago he had an \"international perspective and his own position\", a former senior Kremlin official told the BBC.The Kremlin used to consult him even when it knew he might have a different view to Mr Putin, says Mr Gabuev.But when troops were sent into Ukraine in 2022, Mr Lavrov only found out a few hours before the war began, according to a report in the Financial Times.Andrei Kelin, Moscow's ambassador to the UK, rejects the idea that Russian diplomats have lost their influence. He has worked on relations with Western countries throughout his diplomatic career.In an interview with the BBC, he refused to concede that either Moscow or individual diplomats bear any responsibility for the collapse of relations with the West.\"We are not the ones doing the destroying,\" he said. \"We have problems with the Kyiv regime. There is nothing we can do about it.\"He says war in Ukraine is \"a continuation of diplomacy by other means\".Diplomacy as a spectacleAs foreign policy officials became less and less influential, they turned their attention back to Russia. Maria Zakharova, who became the ministry's spokesperson in 2015, is a symbol of this new chapter.\"Before her, diplomats behaved like diplomats, speaking in refined expressions,\" says former foreign ministry official Boris Bondarev, who resigned in protest over the war.But with Ms Zakharova's arrival, foreign ministry briefings became a spectacle. Ms Zakharova often yelled at reporters who asked her difficult questions and responded to criticism from other countries with insults.Her diplomatic colleagues were going the same way. Mr Bondarev, who used to work for Moscow's mission to the UN in Geneva, recalls one meeting where Russia blocked all proposed initiatives, prompting colleagues from Switzerland to complain.\"We said to them: 'Well, what's the problem? We are a great power, and you are just Switzerland!'\"That's [Russian] diplomacy for you,\" he says.This approach was aimed at impressing Russians back home, says Mr Gabuev, the foreign policy analyst.But an even more crucial target audience for diplomats is their own bosses, according to Mr Bondarev. Official telegrams sent to Moscow after foreign meetings are focussed on how passionately diplomats defended the country's interests, he explains.A typical message, according to him, would be something like: \"We really gave them a hard time! We heroically defended Russian interests, and the Westerners couldn't do anything and backed down!\"If everyone writes about \"putting Westerners in their place\" and you write that you \"achieved consensus\", you will be looked at with disdain, he says.Mr Bondarev recalls a dinner in Geneva in January 2022 when Mr Ryabkov, from the foreign ministry, met US officials. US First Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman hoped to avert the invasion of Ukraine through 11th-hour negotiations.\"It was awful,\" says Mr Bondarev. \"The Americans were like, 'Let's negotiate.' And instead Ryabkov starts shouting, 'We need Ukraine! We won't go anywhere without Ukraine! Take all your stuff and go back to the 1997 [Nato] borders!' Sherman is an iron lady, but I think even her jaw dropped at this.\"[Ryabkov] was always very polite and really nice to talk to. And now he's banging his fist on the table and talking nonsense.\"It should be noted that, in recent years, the diplomatic tone has changed in other countries too, albeit on a smaller scale.A few years earlier, Japan's representative for human rights at the UN, Hideaki Ueda, demanded that foreign colleagues \"shut up\" at a meeting. Gavin Williamson used the same words against Russia when he was the UK defence secretary. And Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, last year referred to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz as an \"offended liver sausage\".The US can't snap their fingers and end this warAfter a year and a half of war, is there any hope that diplomacy could help to bring the fighting to an end?Most of the people the BBC spoke to think it is highly unlikely. Usually, 95% of diplomats' work is \"unofficial meetings and having coffee\", explains Mr Bondarev. Such contacts have greatly declined, he says - there is no longer much to talk about.Ambassador Kelin has been banned from entering the UK Parliament. At one point, he says, the Russian embassy in London was almost left without gas and electricity, and insurance companies refused to insure the mission's cars.Sooner or later, dialogue will have to happen, says RAND analyst Samuel Charap. The only alternative to negotiations is \"absolute victory\", and it's unlikely either Kyiv or Moscow could achieve this on the battlefield, he argues.But he does not expect talks to happen soon. \"Putin has changed pretty dramatically over the course of his term in power,\" he says. \"And frankly, I don't know whether he's going to be willing to engage.\"The Ukrainian authorities complain that Russia is once again offering ultimatums instead of compromises, such as demanding that Ukraine accepts the annexation of occupied territories. Kyiv has no intention to negotiate under such conditions, and its Western allies publicly support this decision.Russia seems set on relying on its military machine, intelligence services and geo-economic power for influence - rather than diplomacy.In these dispiriting circumstances, why aren't Russian diplomats simply voting with their feet and resigning from the foreign service altogether?\"It's a problem for everyone who's been stuck in their positions for 10 to 20 years,\" a former Kremlin employee told the BBC. \"There's no other life for you. It's terrifying.\"Mr Bondarev, the former diplomat, can relate to that. \"If it hadn't been for the war, I probably would have stayed and put up with it,\" he says.\"The job isn't so bad. You sit, suffer a bit and in the evening you go out.\"   ", "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u9N5UnvXPnfvN0WFuvUezNKpeXVFO-MUEjeqQTQprramyzn4ZzHMAmOjOm0LINB-krmnKNXab9i_3pnM1ULLmpRLa7u1iqMxBiaQkEa8UA=s1200", "image_text": "  South Africa was not in the original Bric bloc formed in 2009, they later joined in 2010.

And with fewer passengers to tussle over, some of the yellow, fume-belching buses, pride of the city's eternal hustle spirit, now idle at motor parks.The notorious miles-long traffic jams have drastically reduced.This bustling city of an estimated 20 million people is quieter, but for once that is not a good thing.What Lagos has gained in tranquillity it has lost economically since President Bola Tinubu abruptly ended the supply of cheap fuel in his first day in office at the end of May.Oil-rich Nigeria, he said, could no longer afford to subsidise petrol which was costing billions of dollars a year.Mr Tinubu also ended currency restrictions that had been put in place by the previous government, and while many experts agree that it was the right thing to do, it has led to a weakening of the local currency.The double whammy of rising fuel costs and a weak currency has sent the economy into a tailspin, and nowhere is the biting hardship more apparent than in Lagos - a commercial behemoth that is often a snapshot of the rest of the country.Many small businesses have packed up, and some low-income earners who live in the suburbs of the mainland and commute to the business districts on Lagos Island have stopped going to work.\"I was spending 600 naira a day on transport, it jumped to 1,000 naira. By the end of the month I was spending all my salary on transport,\" a cleaner said, adding that she had been forced to resign from her job.She lives in Ikorodu, a congested part of Lagos state, which is popular with low-income earners.Previously, the 41km (25 miles) between Ikorodu and upmarket Victoria Island took two-three hours during rush hour. Now, it can be done in 45-50 minutes.Recent\u00a0data from the National Bureau of Statistics\u00a0showed that when compared to the second quarter of 2022, the contribution of road transport to the economy within the same period this year fell by around 47%.As that data only captured one month since the policy changed, things could be even worse now.That economic hit would have been mostly felt in Lagos, home of Nigeria's busiest port and the city that the Nigerian president prides himself on building.\"He was right to remove [the] subsidy but not at this time, not without fixing the refineries,\" said professor of Economics Uchechi Ogbuagu.\u00a0Because Nigeria's oil refineries are not functioning, most fuel is actually imported.\"An essential commodity like energy - if you tamper with the price, there will be a multiplier effect,\" he said.What to do with the expensive fuel subsidy was one of the major talking-points before elections earlier this year, with almost all economists and politicians agreeing that it had to go.Nigeria was spending money it did not have to keep fuel prices low and it was no longer sustainable, the arguments went.Previous investigations found that the system was riddled with corruption, and as was evident after it was stopped, a large portion of the subsidised fuel was smuggled to neighbouring countries where it was sold at higher rates.Some experts and government agencies argued that the fuel subsidy benefited rich Nigerians more than the poor, while opponents said removing it would inflict hardship on the latter group.But even among those who wanted the subsidy gone was an admission that it needed to be done in phases, certain things had to be put in place first.The labour unions wanted the local refineries working, the main opposition wanted government to get out of the oil-importation market.Others asked for subsidised transportation - especially to move farm products, and there were also questions about how the money saved would be used.But despite having some of these in his manifesto, Mr Tinubu used an off-the-cuff remark in his first speech as president to remove the subsidy, initially sending the system into shock before prices went up.\"I was possessed with courage and I said 'subsidy is gone',\" Mr Tinubu said of his now-famous remark on 29 May.\"We are tired of feeding smugglers, making few people rich and subsidising the next-door neighbour,\" he later said at a function in France.With prices of petrol up, small businesses like the popular motorcycle food-delivery companies, that provided employment to young people, have had to rethink their strategies.Some workers have been laid off while others like Happiness Emmanuel have resorted to using bicycles for deliveries, a rare sight in the scorching heat of Lagos, where there is a lack of bicycle lanes.\"I make more money and it is less expensive to maintain,\" he told the BBC at his food court location in the Ikeja area.Some of his colleagues have also started using bicycles because of the high cost of fuel, he said.Even the city's Bus Rapid Transport, which recently added electric buses to its fleet, has seen an upsurge by as much as 30%, a spokesman told the BBC.This was helped by prices that were halved by the government, he said.The state is also commencing operations on its metro system on Monday, and its affordable fares should get more residents on the move again.President Tinubu announced in early August that more than 1 trillion naira ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) had been saved since subsidy was removed - money that otherwise would have gone to \"smugglers and fraudsters\", he said.He acknowledged the hardship, asked people to \"look beyond the present temporary pains,\" and assured that saved funds would benefit families.Tuition loans\u00a0have been introduced for poor families with children in university and talks are ongoing for the minimum wage to be raised.The government has also distributed grains, announced plans to convert cars from fuel to gas, while some states have introduced electric buses.For some, the current realities put an end to the arguments about who benefits from the fuel subsidy. Many want it back and now argue that fuel subsidy is not a bad if it can be ring-fenced from corruption.\"Subsidy, if implemented well, benefits all,\" said Prof Ogbuagu.\"Everybody was buying fuel at the same price. The poor may not have lots of TVs and fridges, but transport fares would be low,\" he said.Mr Tinubu has assured that there are no further plans for petrol prices to rise - which ought to happen as the naira weakened further - all but signalling that the subsidy was back.He has also announced his cabinet, filling up important posts that are crucial in driving the economy.It demonstrates how difficult it is to do away with what is a popular policy, even for President Tinubu who has often boasted of having the will to carry out difficult decisions.He will not be the first Nigerian president to walk back on the scrapping of the fuel subsidy, though predecessors faced far stiffer opposition, such as nationwide protests in 2012.There have been pockets of protests in some states against the hardship and the labour unions staged lacklustre demonstrations but they barely registered.Such demonstrations have often kicked off in Lagos in the past, with other parts of Nigeria feeding off its energy to join in.But for once, the city that never sleeps is low on fumes, literally and metaphorically.

He said they would avoid elections that \"repeat the same mistakes\" by keeping the same people in power.However, our source said that the new strongman, the head of the elite Republican Guard, was \"a direct product of the Bongo clan. He is the spiritual son of Omar Bongo and has always been closely tied to the presidential family\", adding that some believe he is Ali Bongo's cousin.Omar Bongo was in power for 41 years before his son Ali succeeded him following his death in 2009.Ali Bongo's subsequent election victories have always been marred by opposition claims of widespread fraud.Our source said that the coup caught everyone unawares, despite rumours floating around Gen Nguema.\"It completely took our team by surprise but for the past two years, there had been rumours alleging that if there was one man capable of disrupting the hierarchy, it would have to be him. He has always played a crucial role within the Bongo clan and has a natural but discrete authority.\"It is said that just before Omar Bongo's death in 2009, Gen Nguema promised him he would look after his family. However, when Ali Bongo took over, the military man was sent away to serve as an attach\u00e9 to the Gabonese embassies in Morocco and Senegal.\"Upon his return in 2019, Gen Nguema realised that the power circle had extended beyond the close members of the family and that the state control was slipping out of the grasp of the Bongo clan,\" explains our source. This was after Ali Bongo suffered a stroke which side-lined him for a year and prompted calls for him to step aside.The coup has seen many people take to the streets of the Gabonese capital, Libreville, to celebrate but our source says this is mainly because \"they wanted to be freed from the Bongo family name\".\"But the reality is that the coup is very much a continuation of the same system just with a different name.\"Shortly after the coup was announced, several allies of the ousted president were arrested, including his 31-year-old son Noureddin Bongo Valentin, who has been accused of high treason and corruption. National TV has shown images of him and other close Bongo allies in front of suitcases of cash it said had been seized from their homes. They have not commented on the allegations.But our source says this is largely for show.\"He wants to send a strong message to the population by arresting the president's son.\"Everyone is celebrating now but we shouldn't forget that the transition leader ate at the Bongo family's table for decades.

", "content": "   Friends of a doctor who died in Nigeria because the lift in her hospital accommodation fell nine floors with her inside are not surprised by a new study that reveals the country spends twice as much money on debt repayments as on health and education combined.The major new report from the One Campaign, an anti-poverty group, focuses on the staggering amount of private loans that African countries have to service, often to the detriment of development.It is not possible to draw a direct causal link between Nigeria's debt crisis and the death last month of Dr Vwaere Diaso, but every dollar spent servicing debt is one that cannot go into vital infrastructure.Dr Diaso was just two weeks away from finishing her training at Lagos General Hospital when she died.She had repeatedly complained to management about the crumbling infrastructure, power cuts and lack of funding in one of Nigeria's major public hospitals. She knew it was costing the lives of patients. She had no idea it would also cost her own.\"I remember Vwaere for her smile, she was the world's happiest person,\" her friend and colleague Dr Joy Aifuobhokhan tells us. \"She actually loved her job and she loved to take care of people.\"Dr Diaso suffered massive trauma after the elevator plummeted, but might have survived, had the hospital's oxygen supply and other facilities been working.\"I believe funding was a major issue in both our accommodation and the hospital in general. We complained to the management but the response we would get is that they did not even have enough funds to supply electricity to the hospital, let alone to spend money on the doctors' quarters.\"It is just one example of a healthcare system in crisis. In 2018, Nigeria spent $5.9bn (\u00a34.7bn) repaying loans. This year it is forecast to spend $8.4bn. That compares to just $2.2bn on education and $1.4bn on healthcare.The One Campaign report estimates the poorest nations are paying 500% more for debt than they need to.The organisation, which aims to reduce poverty particularly in Africa, has people like former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, former British Prime Minister David Cameron and former Meta boss Sheryl Sandberg on its board.It is led by Gayle E Smith, a former adviser to three US presidents who also used to run US development spending. She says that the situation now is potentially bigger than the debt crisis of 2005.\"This is more countries simultaneously heading into crisis. And I think that this is going to have greater ripple effects, if you look at the number of countries that are at risk,\" says Ms Smith, warning of the economic and political consequences.Why is it happening?While the situation has been getting worse for a few years, the report says that rising interest rates in the US have supercharged the problem.Rate rises cause the dollar to strengthen, in turn devaluing currencies like Nigeria's naira. Since most foreign debt is held in dollars, this instantly makes the problem worse.On top of that, there is a well-established connection between the interest rate offered by the Federal Reserve, the US's central bank, and the rate commercial lenders will offer to other countries.Add to this the soaring inflation seen around the world and a lack of finance from lenders like the World Bank.\"We've seen for the first time in 25 years an increase in extreme poverty,\" Ms Smith says about the impact already being witnessed.\"We saw a huge negative impact on health and education and the progress that's been made over the years.\"If you're spending over 90% of your budget on servicing debt, there's not much left to do anything with. And so breaking that cycle is near impossible.\"The report calls for a massive increase in lending by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global lenders.The calls are similar to those made by the recent Bridgetown Initiative, spearheaded by Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley,\u00a0who wants reform and modernisation of the international monetary system.Of course, global institutions are not the only bodies being called on to reform.\"If you don't deal with issues around corruption, we're just going to be a lot of talk and no action,\" says Sam Chidoka, an expert on good governance in Nigeria.He worries that the benefits of any debt reduction would not be passed to the people.\"There's nothing wrong with borrowing. It is what you do with money you borrowed. Has it been used to make the country more productive or are we borrowing to finance lifestyles, fly private jets and run large convoys for government functionaries?\"The issue of corruption is one the report does not deal with directly, but not one Ms Smith shies away from.\"There's no question that there needs to be transparency around the money that is provided. Policy and governance is a problem, but it is not\u00a0the\u00a0problem.\"Many will be reminded of the Make Poverty History campaign of 2005, and with good reason. The report's authors helped set up that global movement, which saw a landmark deal on debt. While that did have a lasting impact, things are possibly even worse than they were before that was signed.Following Make Poverty History, African external debt fell to a little more than $180bn. Now, it stands at $645bn, with private loans making up a far larger proportion of the total.\"We're not talking about the need for global charity,\" says Ms Smith.\"It is in the interest of Europe and the United States, Canada, the whole of the G7, plus indeed the G20, to see Africa develop.\"That argument, that this is about enlightened self-interest rather than benevolence, is central to this report.Debt-crippled economies fail to help tackle climate change or provide opportunities for their young people, who then seek opportunities in Europe or elsewhere.That exodus is already being seen in Nigeria's healthcare system, with many young doctors seeking opportunities abroad because of poor pay and conditions. According to Dr Aifuobhokhan, her friend Dr Diaso was one of those who did not want to leave.\"Then this incident happened where we see that someone is clearly dying because of poorly funded facilities, no infrastructure or emergency responses.\"   ", "image": "https:", "image_text": "", "source_link": "https://www.the-star.co.ke/publication/custom/static/logo.png", "category": "https://www.the-star.co.ke//news/africa/2023-09-01-what-doctors-death-in-a-lift-tells-us-about-africas-debt-crisis/"}, {"title": " DR Congo forces criticised as 43 protesters killed ", "sub_title": " The government says it has begun an investigation into the matter.

He was foaming at the mouth. He had inhaled so much smoke and was in such a state of shock that he was unable to stand on his own.The paramedics took him to the hospital and she hasn't heard about his condition since.Ms Ngcobo stayed behind, waiting at the scene of the fire for more information on where her two-year-old's body has been taken.She wants to say goodbye, to have some closure.\"I don't know what to do, I don't know where to go,\" she said. \"I don't know what hospital my child is in, and I don't know what mortuary my other child is in. So I'll wait here for news.\"Mr Hamissa and Ms Ngobo were sitting in a group of about 50 people, all trying to get some sleep while they waited for officials to tell them what would happen.There was a stench in the air of old smoke and expired food.

", "content": "   A hacking group called Anonymous Sudan took X, formerly known as Twitter, offline in more than a dozen countries on Tuesday morning in an attempt to pressurise Elon Musk into launching his Starlink service in their country.X was down for more than two hours, with thousands of users affected.\"Make our message reach to Elon Musk: 'Open Starlink in Sudan',\" the hackers posted on Telegram.X is the latest victim of the gang attacking to \"benefit Sudan and Islam\".Over several weeks of private conversations with the group on the chat app Telegram, the BBC spoke to the hackers about their methods and motives.One member of the group, who calls himself Crush, told the BBC that Tuesday's attack flooded X's servers with huge amounts of traffic to take it offline - the same blunt and relatively unsophisticated hacking techniques for which the gang is known.The outage-tracking site Downdetector said nearly 20,000 outage reports were logged by users in the US and the UK, with a far higher number of people likely to have been affected.Another hacking group member - Hofa - said the so-called DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack was aimed at raising awareness about the civil war in Sudan which is \"making the internet very bad and it goes down quite often for us\".X has not publicly acknowledged the disruption caused, and Mr Musk has not responded to questions to launch his satellite internet service in Sudan.Located in SudanThe gang has been accused by many in the cyber-security world of being a Russian cyber-military unit in disguise and causing cyber-chaos for the Kremlin under the cover of a foreign hacktivist outfit.The theory stems from its online support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and an apparent alignment of motives with other hacking gangs in the country.But the criminal group has repeatedly denied it is Russian, and for the first time shared evidence with the BBC that it is located in Sudan.Crush, the group's main spokesperson and key member, shared his live location on the Telegram app as proof.Crush and Hofa also sent pictures of their Sudanese passports and other screenshots suggesting they are in Sudan.These things can be faked with varying degrees of difficulty, but after weeks of conversation with the BBC and cyber-security researcher Intel Cocktail, there is nothing to suggest the hackers are lying.\"Our long-term goal is to show the world that Sudanese people, although with limited capabilities, have very good skills in many different fields,\" said Crush.In June, the gang posted a message of support for the Russian government to end an ongoing rebellion by the Wagner forces.However, Crush explained that \"a similar thing happened to our country and Russians stood with us so we wanted to pay them back\", referring to Russia's support for the Sudanese government as it fights the ongoing civil war.He insists that their group is made up of a \"small number\" of Sudanese hackers who are launching the attacks from the country in spite of regular internet outages.Since it emerged in January, Anonymous Sudan has successfully disrupted dozens of organisations and government web services in France, Nigeria, Israel and the US.For the past month the gang has attacked Kenya, claiming the country's government is \"meddling in Sudanese affairs\".One attack heavily\u00a0disrupted the country's eCitizen portal\u00a0used by the public to access more than 5,000 government services.When challenged about the impacts on citizens, Crush defended the actions and said: \"The reason we hit infrastructure is to teach the country and its rulers a lesson, and yes we have red lines, that is if our attacks harm a lot of innocents.\"However, the group has also unsuccessfully attacked hospitals.The gang claims to be carrying out the criminal attacks to \"defend the Truth, Islam and Sudan\", but on at least two occasions it has also tried to extort victims for Bitcoin.It has also targeted websites like OnlyFans, Tumblr and Reddit, saying that they promote what it calls \"disgusting smuts and other LGBTQ+ things\".In June, the hackers celebrated when the US cyber-authority issued an official\u00a0warning about a wave of attacks\u00a0against American organisations which it warned \"can cost an organisation time and money and may impose reputational costs while resources and services are inaccessible\".Its most high-profile attack in June disrupted Microsoft services including Outlook and OneDrive, forcing the tech giant to\u00a0issue a report with advice\u00a0to customers on how to prevent being affected by the group.

It was a tough decision to make because of the close contest,\" the source said.\"We finally decided to pick Kimani for the job after a painstaking search,\" the source said.Kimani joined Bandari in February 2021 to deputise Rwandese tactician Andre Casa Mbungo who also happened to be his boss at AFC Leopards.Kimani took over the reins in an acting capacity in February last year after Mbungo was sent packing following a horrendous run in the league.The ex-Kenyan international and Mathare United defender was ultimately confirmed to the role in August last year after impressing in the second leg of the preceding campaign.He is expected to turn around the fortunes of the soldiers who have endured a long spell without any major local silverware since 2010 when they last clinched the KPL title.Ulinzi have been rummaging through the market for a suitable candidate following the departure of Bernard Mwalala who switched allegiance to KCB at the beginning of July.Initially based at Lanet in Nakuru county, the Kenya Defence Forces affiliated club recently shifted base to the newly constructed Ulinzi Sports Complex at Langata in Nairobi.They romped to consecutive titles from 2003 to 2005 and bagged another one in 2010.

Clean energy investment in Africa represents only 2 per cent of the global total and less than 10 per cent of the $120 billion a year that is required. We must transform the way we deploy public, concessional, and philanthropic capital to drive the private investment that is needed for climate action in Africa.We need to fundamentally rethink the way financiers, governments, global institutions, and technology providers engage with each other.

It was not immediately clear how long he would stay in jail.The reporter was picked up at his home outside Dhaka early on Wednesday morning by plain-clothes officers.His employers had no idea of his whereabouts for nearly 30 hours as police and other security agencies said they had no information on him.The report for which Mr Shams was detained featured ordinary Bangladeshis talking about their lives on Independence Day.One quotation was from a labourer who asked: \"What is the use of this freedom if we can't afford rice?\"The comment was seen to reflect growing worries about escalating food prices, which have soared around the world since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The Prothom Alo article was shared by large numbers of people. When the paper posted the report on Facebook, it used a wrong photo of a person.\"Once we realised the error, we immediately pulled it down and issued a clarification under the (amended) report,\" Sajjad Sharif, the paper's executive editor, told the BBC.\"But we stand by the original report. The quote of the labourer on the food price was genuine,\" he said.But supporters of the governing Awami League accused the daily of tarnishing the image of the country.Police have also launched an investigation against its editor, Matiur Rahman, as well as a video journalist from the newspaper and several other people under the controversial Digital Security Act (DSA).Law Minister Anisul Haq said Mr Shams had \"misrepresented facts with the mala fide intention of creating discontent\".\"The case was filed by an individual not by the government. Due process will follow,\" Mr Haq told the BBC.He said the editor and the publisher of the daily also had responsibility for the report - and that's why police were investigating them.The latest developments come amid concerns over the alleged harassment of human rights defenders and media personnel in the build-up to elections later this year.The Media Freedom Coalition, an initiative by a group of Western nations in Dhaka, has expressed\u00a0concern over recent reports of violence and intimidation of journalists, including the detention in the Prothom Alo case.Bangladeshi journalists say there are increasingly under pressure for reporting that is critical of the government of Sheikh Hasina. They say the DSA has created a culture of fear.According to media rights groups, cases have been filed against around 280 journalists under the DSA since it was enacted in 2018.Mr Haq says the government is working with media houses on issues concerning the act. \"I engaged with them [editors] to remove the fear. We are trying to take the best practices. If the DSA has to be improved we will make rules to do that,\" he said.

As a union, we cannot ask teachers to demonstrate on the streets when their issues can be dealt with diplomatically and amicably by the employer and the unions,\" said Oyuu.In the 2023/2024 Budget Policy Statement, the TSC has been allocated Sh322 billion.

The relationship is calmer,\" the Moroccan writer and political scientist Hassan Aourid told AFP.\"There are unquestionably segments of Moroccan society that have a very emotional relationship with France,\" he added.\u00a0- 'Language of elite' -\u00a0But Aourid acknowledged that the growing influence of pan-Arabism and Islamism meant there were now also segments in society for whom France is not just a Western country, \"but the enemy who dominated and colonised Morocco\".In a sign of the emotional complexities of the game, many on the Moroccan team were born outside the country, including in France, such as manager Walid Regragui and defender Romain Saiss.France are the overwhelming favourites to win the showdown and keep alive their hopes of retaining the World Cup.But with Morocco emerging as the breakout team in this World Cup -- and with rousing support from across the Arab and African world -- it coud yet pull off one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition.Moroccan independence put an end to 44 years of French and Spanish protectorates over separate parts of its territory.Since then, France has become Morocco's leading economic partner and by far the main foreign investor. And French culture remains very popular among Moroccan elite, most of whom were trained in French institutions.Ruled by King Mohammed VI, the country is seen as a Western ally in North Africa, and in 2020 he angered some in the Muslim world including Algeria by re-establishing ties with Israel and pursuing security cooperation with the Jewish state.But elsewhere in Africa, France has seen its influence eroded in recent years by new competitors, as shown by growing numbers of schools teaching in standard Arabic and English as well as the presence of China's controversial Confucius Institutes.The younger generations in particular \"have seized on English because it is the language of new technology and social networks, but also because French is seen as the language of the elite,\" the prominent young Moroccan novelist Hajar Azell told AFP.\u00a0- 'Feeling of hostility' -\u00a0The rise in importance of relationships other than with France has led to a loss of \"economic and political influence\" of France in Morocco, Beatrice Hibou, a director of research at France's CNRS institute, told AFP.But the greatest source of tension stems from a decision taken by France at the end of 2021 to halve to the number of entry visas granted to Moroccans every year, citing its reluctance to readmit illegal immigrants who have arrived in France.Rabat had slammed the move as \"unjustified\".\"We must not underestimate the question of visas, which is crucial,\" said Hibou, adding that Morocco saw the French move \"as a slap in the face, with a real anti-French feeling and a great waste.\"There are also bilateral tensions over the conflict in Western Sahara has pitted Morocco against the Sahrawi independence fighters of the Polisario Front, supported by Algeria, for more than 40 years.Moroccan academic Ali Bouabid told AFP that he fears the controversy will leave a lasting mark fuelling a \"feeling of hostility towards France\".

The one near Gaziantep was estimated to be 7.8, classified as \"major\", on the official magnitude scale. Its centre was relatively shallow at about 18km (11 miles), causing serious damage to buildings on the surface.Prof Joanna Faure Walker, head of the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction at University College London, said: \"Of the deadliest earthquakes in any given year, only two in the last 10 years have been of equivalent magnitude, and four in the previous 10 years.\"But it is not only the power of the tremor that causes devastation.This incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, when people were inside and sleeping.The sturdiness of the buildings is also a factor.Dr Carmen Solana, reader in volcanology and risk communication at the University of Portsmouth, says: \"The resistant infrastructure is unfortunately patchy in South Turkey and especially Syria, so saving lives now mostly relies on response. The next 24 hours are crucial to find survivors. After 48 hours the number of survivors decreases enormously.\"This was a region where there had not been a major earthquake for more than 200 years or any warning signs, so the level of preparedness would be less than for a region which was more used to dealing with tremors.What caused the earthquake?The Earth's crust is made up of separate bits, called plates, that nestle alongside each other.These plates often try to move but are prevented by the friction of rubbing up against an adjoining one. But sometimes the pressure builds until one plate suddenly jerks across, causing the surface to move.In this case it was the Arabian plate moving northwards and grinding against the Anatolian plate.Friction from the plates has been responsible for very damaging earthquakes in the past.On 13 August 1822 it caused an earthquake registering 7.4 in magnitude, significantly less than the 7.8 magnitude recorded on Monday.Even so, the 19th Century earthquake resulted in immense damage to towns in the area, with 7,000 deaths recorded in the city of Aleppo alone. Damaging aftershocks continued for nearly a year.There have already been several aftershocks following the current earthquake and scientists are expecting it to follow the same trend as the previous big one in the region.How are earthquakes measured?They are measured on a scale called the moment magnitude scale.A tremor of 2.5 or less usually cannot be felt, but can be detected by instruments. Quakes of up to five are felt and cause minor damage. The Turkish earthquake at 7.8 is classified as major and usually causes serious damage, as it has in this instance.Anything above 8 causes catastrophic damage and can totally destroy communities at its centre.How does this compare with other large earthquakes?The earthquake off the coast of Japan in 2011 was registered as magnitude 9 and caused widespread damage on the land, and caused a series of giant tidal waves - one of which led to a major accident at nuclear plant along the coast.The largest ever earthquake was 9.5 recorded in Chile in 1960.

She had been shot in the temple and her death was ruled a homicide.The autopsy concluded she had been dead since about June of 1978 and that she was between 19 and 27 years old. But her identity remained a mystery.\"It was advances in forensic science, and in particular, forensic genetic genealogy that provided a new source of hope for identifying the victim,\" said First Assistant Northwestern District Attorney Steven Gagne at a press conference on Monday.About two years ago, authorities obtained Ms Tucker's DNA profile through a forensic laboratory and eventually identified a woman in Maryland who was likely related to her.That relative told police that her aunt had gone missing in the 1970s and she gave police the names of her aunt's two sons, Mr Gagne said.One of those sons, Matthew Dale, confirmed his mother, Patricia Tucker, went missing in 1978. Comparison of his DNA to Ms Tucker's DNA resulted in a 100% parent-child match, officials said.\"While it's satisfying to finally know who 'Granby Girl' actually was, the investigation won't stop until we identify her killer,\" said Mr Gagne.Investigators found Ms Tucker was married to Gerald Coleman at the time of her death but he never reported his wife missing. In 1995, Coleman was convicted on charges including rape and assault, and he died in prison in 1996.Police say Coleman is a \"person of interest\" in his wife's murder.\"We do not yet formally have probable cause to charge anyone with Patricia's murder,\" Mr Gagne said. \"Our hope is that today's press conference will generate some additional leads that will help to move this investigation further and ultimately identify a murderer.\"   ", "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-w9nRKVgSeDeq58rvGnhpcc5pZXe5S_BHgA_8elU2BGDQpVOsKpvqIsYMS-q4q0NOALfQA4fn5OqtJvoC8sQttoPpYypPlW407PrsJ5W=s1200", "image_text": "  Patricia Ann Tucker was identified after a DNA match with her son\n ", "source_link": "https://www.the-star.co.ke/publication/custom/static/logo.png", "category": "https://www.the-star.co.ke//news/world/2023-03-07-granby-girl-identified-45-years-after-her-murder/"}, {"title": " Kenya Kwanza insincere on forest conservation \u2013 Raila ", "sub_title": " \"I have been frequently flying over the forest and what I'm currently seeing is total destruction.\" ", "summary": " In Summary   \u2022 Raila said the move by the government to allow people to cut trees in forests is a clear indication that the government is ignorant to the protection of all water towers.\n\u2022 He reiterated that his opponents used the controversial Mau forest issue to fight him politically when he was the Prime Minister in the grand coalition government.

It was a tough decision to make because of the close contest,\" the source said.\"We finally decided to pick Kimani for the job after a painstaking search,\" the source said.Kimani joined Bandari in February 2021 to deputise Rwandese tactician Andre Casa Mbungo who also happened to be his boss at AFC Leopards.Kimani took over the reins in an acting capacity in February last year after Mbungo was sent packing following a horrendous run in the league.The ex-Kenyan international and Mathare United defender was ultimately confirmed to the role in August last year after impressing in the second leg of the preceding campaign.He is expected to turn around the fortunes of the soldiers who have endured a long spell without any major local silverware since 2010 when they last clinched the KPL title.Ulinzi have been rummaging through the market for a suitable candidate following the departure of Bernard Mwalala who switched allegiance to KCB at the beginning of July.Initially based at Lanet in Nakuru county, the Kenya Defence Forces affiliated club recently shifted base to the newly constructed Ulinzi Sports Complex at Langata in Nairobi.They romped to consecutive titles from 2003 to 2005 and bagged another one in 2010.
